##About me

  ![self-potrait](/images/me.jpg){:class="right"}
  I am an self-taught craftman, I like design and build stuff with computers.

  In 2011, I led the UI design and frontend development at [eleme](http://ele.me/at/entry/1) and build a [webapp](http://ele.me/napos.php) there. And currently I am starting up a [company](http://zenhacks.org/) at Shanghai.

  I am fluent in `javascript`/`coffeescript` and `Ruby`. I worked with `Symfony` and `Django` before. But now I am using `Rails` to create web application and  `nodeJS` to do some cutting edge experiments. You could find me on [github](https://github.com/yangchenyun) and [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/966437/steven-yang). I am also fascinated about [Unix's philosophy](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html).

  Creating useful products with elegance is what drives me so far.

  By the way, my name is Steven Yang graduated from Zhejiang University with a Bachelor degree in Economics.

  I'd love to collect [inspiration](http://quote.yangchenyun.com) to keep myself motivated and do volunteer work at [TEDxFivestarsquare](http://ted.yangchenyun.com).

  This site is created with [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and hosted on [github](http://github.com).
