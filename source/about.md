##About me

  ![self-potrait](/images/me.jpg){:class="right"}
  I am an self-taught craftman, I like build and design products with computers.

  In 2011, I led the UI design and frontend development at a start-up([site](http://ele.me/at/entry/1), [webapp](http://ele.me/napos.php)).

  I also collect [inspiration](http://quote.yangchenyun.com) to keep myself motivated and volunteer to work at [TEDxFivestarsquare](http://tedxfivestarsquare.com).

  My toolkit consists of `javaScript`/`coffeescript`, `HTML5` and `CSS3`. I also use `Ruby` for scripting. For the backend, I have worked with projects based on `Rails`, `Django` and `Symfony`. I am also fascinated about Unix's simplified philosophy after switching my workspace from the cumbersome Windows system.

  Currently, I am developing and organizing design and develop knowledge on the front-end side while digging more deeper into the details. Besides, I am also learning basic system administration, data abstraction and `Rails` to accomplish my personal projects. Because...

  >Creating useful products with elegance is what drives me so far.

  By the way, my name is Steven Yang graduated from Zhejiang University with a Bachelor degree in Economics.

##About the Site

  The site come to exist for selfish reasons.

  I need a place to organize the knowledge I acquired day in day out. The process to write a public article forces me to pay attention to details and think solutions in a structured way.

  Besides, I am learning `Ruby` and how the full web stack works, so I need a project to get my hands dirty.

  This site is created with [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and hosted on [github](http://github.com).
