## Highlights
At the 2nd week, I went to Beijing and joined in ScentLibrary(气味图书馆) to help build the whole tech department. Thanks to this opportunity, I could setup the whole network tech stack from scratch - from the network topology design, routing rules, DNS/DHCP setup, firewall rules and server service setups. This provides me a solid experience when I started up my own company later this year.

I peaked Mt.Haba(5396m) in May. It is my first snow mountain, I've been preparing it since the start of this year. The 14-hour continuous ascending is both challenging and exciting, I am quite proud of myself when I finished it.

Late in May, supported by TZG Partners, Peter and I went back to Shanghai and based on our shared understanding of technology and business we started our first [ship][zenhacks-site] in the real world. We tried our ideas such as [this][manzuo-site]. 

In November, we realized our idea with [Huali][huali-site](花里花店) after one month's crafting and preparation. This tiny project finally becomes alive now with the support of a lovely team.

## Achievement in Hacking
The main achievements in 2012 are mostly in the fields of hacking. Comparing with the first year I step into programming, there are three improvements:

- More output. Especially in the 2nd half year, I am more active in writing programs because the familarity with programming environment and fluency in programming language.
- Wider range of fields. The kind of programs I crafted this year varied a lot, it ranges from command line tools, page parser bots, deployment scripts, API wrapper and mostly web application.
- Wise choice of tools. Last year, I could only follow the choices of the herd but now I could weigh the options I have at hands and choose between them wisely. 

### System Administration
In 2012, I completed the following projects related with system administration:

- Set up a corporate ethernet infrastructure in ScentLibrary using a linux box as gateway, DNS and DHCP server.
- Accomplished the Stanford open course "An Introduction to Computer Networks" with a score of 880/960. [^1]
- Summarized the knowledge to config ubuntu server for deployment with [`capistrano-zen`][cap-zen] and open-sourced it.

As all the administration work is laied out on linux, I became more familiar with it. I studied one of the best invention on unix - the pipeline and wrote [an illustrated article][unix-pipe-article] about it. I also touched the surface of the book ["the art of unix programming"][aoup-book] to know more about the programming styles of unix.

Among all the tool, I invested a lot of time in `git` and it paid well. After studying the internals of `git` and I integrated the advanced usage into my daily work flow. I use `git` to check the team member's work, try out new features and share opinions with other people. I also applied an git workflow to the team and it makes team corporation easy. Towards the end of year, I installed an internal git hosting application with `gitolite` and `gitlab`, it provides us more control over the whole system.

I also got to know the basis of network infrastructure of the Internet. I dived into this field with no experience, I struggled for a while - reading acadamic books about computer network, reading mannuals for implementations, trying out new tools. Fortunately, with the help of two friends - [Adieu][adieu-link] and [Zhanzhong][zhanchong-link], I completed the infrastrcture at last. With in the process, I learned all the 'magics' such as DHCP, NAT, Routing tables the hard way. Then after I finished the Stanford course about computer network, I linked all the knowledge together and formed a basic knowledge about how the Internet works. I am more aware of all the details when I accesses the Internet from public Wifi, I could track and analyses the UDP/TCP traffic through my computer. 

### Programming and Web Development
Here is the website, web application or programs I wrote in 2012:

- Made three static sites: [zenhacks][zenhacks-site], [manzuo][manzuo-site], [wazo][wazo-site]. All open-sourced. [^2]
- Accomplished the UC Berkley open course "Software Engineering for Software as a Service" with a score of 1975/2126. [^3]
- Crafted a prototype of [manzuoapp][manzuo-site] with `nodeJS`, `MongoDB` and `Redis`.
- Crafted an e-commerce web application for [huali][huali-site] with `Rails` and `PostgreSQL`.
- Wrote a small tool [ask][ask-repo] one day at a hackthon with my roomate Kuno, it helps you accumulate your knowledge about commandline tools.
- Wrote a simple Ruby wrapper [foxit][foxit-repo] for [gitlab][gitlab-site] API v2.
- Created a bot to parse the railscasts.com and mirror it privately with `express`. The source code is [here][rails-mirror-repo].

Through the working with various web application, I gained an more in depth understanding over HTTP - a communication protocol between two processes across the Internet just as any RPC service. I've worked with well designed APIs such as Github's, designed APIs for manzuoapp and also built wrapper around exist API, I am more aware of the principles behind the whole RESTful idea. 

I adapted the ideas in the [12 factor app][12-factor-app] when design the architecture for the Rails application. I broke down the application into difference unix processes - web apps, background workers and http workers. This separation helps the application to allocate different responsibility into different processes. 

Last but not least, I finally grasped `Ruby` and `Rails`. I finished reading on ['Programming Ruby'][pro-ruby] and began to use `Ruby` to write up day-to-day scripts. I also used `Rails` to build hua.li and all other personal stuff. I am happy to survive with these new tools and look for more fluent usage in the coming new year.

Besides the accomplishment in 2012, I had two main failures this year.

## Main Failure
### Communication Failure with Scentlibrary
The main failure at work is the failed communication with ScentLibrary. I, as the only tech person within the team, doesn't communicate with the management board well. This corporation ended nastily, they ended up with a infrastructure without maintainance, I ended up with financial lose and extra reallocation cost.

I was quite furious when they cancelled the oral commitment without notice and compensation. But when I settled down in Shanghai and talked this issue with Ted, an senior friend at TZG, I realized my own responsibility for that failure. I was too confident and self-centered in the situation. I will cover more of that in [Lesson Learned 2012][lesson-learned-2012].

### Break of Personal Reviewing Habit
Another failure is the break of my planning and reviewing discipline. It results in the gap between the goals set in [the 2012 plan][2012-plan] and the final accomplishment. I sadly found I failed myself in all fields other than hacking. The personal management system I established in 2011 helps me stay focused, fight against distraction and concentration on long term goals which really matters. However, after moving to Shanghai, I stopped this discipline and never resumed it. For the second half year I am still busy but less focused. In the last two months, when the new company started getting busy, a lot of errands chewed up the time which I should have put into long term goals.  

I will address more on this in the [Lesson Learned 2012][lesson-learned-2012]. 

Now I will look the other part of my 2012 walk.

## Other Part of 2012

### Physical Training
For the physical exerice, I kept my weekly schedule the first half year. I would ran 10-20km per week and do some light pushups everyday. However, the exercise stopped when I got back to Shanghai. I didn't do any physical training for the second half year. There might be two reasons for this: 

1. Lack of long-term motivation. I kept the exercise schedule in Beijing because I am preparing for the snow mountain climbing. Once it is achieved, motivation disappears.
2. Lack of community support. I ran with a bunch of friends in Beijing, this support from friends help to keep motivation high.

As a result, my health ended badly. My back and shoulder pain become more severe, once in a while, I feel the back pain every morning when I got up. My sleeping patterns also went worse - I could not sleep before 3/4am and hardly woke up before 12am (if I got time).

To ease the back pain, I switched to a ![standing desk][standing-desk-img] in October and it helped to ease the pain in shoulder and back. I will continue this practice.

Next year, re-establishing the exercise routine will be the main goal.
