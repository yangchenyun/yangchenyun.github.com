Rewrite clues:
  - I used several words for beginners, people want to learn etc. I need to narrow down the definition and concepts.
  - I used a lot of personal examples to demostrate the points I want to make, but I found it too subjective and not convicing and might not be understood by audience without the same experience as I am.
  - Some misuse of words - uncomfortableness / unpleasant / hardness etc.
  - I found a central point at the end of the article - keep the motivation hight.

In late 2010, I decided to pursue my interest in creation instead of jumping into the career as a banker. I began to teach myself programming without any knowledge in that field. Two years have passed and I am now a [professional programmer][github-profile], I design and craft applications used within the company, I make effort to write clean and beautiful code and I keep myself [building more skills][plans-to-read-stdlib].

This is an explorative experience, besides acquiring programming skills, I've also learned and applied some principles about learning itself in general. But I never have the chance or motivation to think, organize and write about them.

Recently, I've started to [learn playing guitar][guitar-plan] and this will be a good chances to sort out those principles and apply them to learning and test whether they work or not.

I hope this could also be a good answer to the frequently asked question - "How could I start learning xxx?".

## Be Inspired, Regularly
Given any book series, the first volumn always outsells later sequences; among any curriculum provided by schools, introductory courses are more popular than more advanced ones; in gym business, registered members is far more than regular ones. People tend to start learning something new on a hunch but few have succeeded to really develop it into a hobby, fewer into a profession. 

Motivated beginners give up shortly after they start off but no blame should be put on them. It is hard to start learning anything. When they **plan** to start learning, they never think about the tedious details, the boring exercises and the uncomfortableness occurring in beginning phase. To a language learner, the vocabulary, grammer and pronounciation could be discouraging, so are the boring scale exercises to a music instrument learner or those magical commands to a
newbie programmer.

To make the situation worse, a beginner usually cannot foresee the outcome of tedious and boring exercises, they cannot receive positive feedback from their effort. 

This is the reason why teacher is usually present in the learning process of a student. A teacher could force the students move forward and thus survive the 'death valley of giving up'. For self-taught learner, this force should be their motivation. They need to keep their motivation high along the whole journey, otherwise it is quite likely they will give it up in the middle of boring exercise.

There is several ways to keep motivation high. One is to look inside. Ask yourself why you want to acquire those skills in the first place. Write them down, paste them on the wall, besides the screen, remind yourself about the motivation all the time. Another is to look outside. Look for inspiration from the masters, watch their performance, read their biography (real story usually is involved with hardwork).

Last but not least, it is important to collect motivation along the way.

## Focus on Steps, One at a Time
Most of the time, people start learning new things with one clear goal - speak Spanish,  play tennis, play violin, learn to program etc. Comparing with these goals, the exercises are merely painful and unpleasant process which have to be taken to reach that destination.

However, unless you are learning for some exams, **the destination of 'something' never exists**. Even for professions, there are always spaces to improve. How could you tell that one writer has reached the "destination of writing", or one musician has developed all the skills to perform music. For any type of activity, there is an endless journey upfront. Anything is important enough to take a life time long effort.

Because there is no destination, the painful and unpleasant daily activities is actual part of the journey. Then instead of complaining about the boring and tedious exercises, we should embrace this experience because this is part of the things we are learning.

Focus on the steps, one at a time and pull the attention to the however tiny progress made everyday. Notice how you've learned to pronounce a new word, how you could play the scale more smooth, how you learned to write a new piece of program clause.

In this way, it would be easier to keep the moral high.

## Start from the basics
In any fields, there are several levels of concepts which might be exposed to beginners. Some are the very basics. For writing in a language, these include vocabulary, grammar and pronounciation; for programming, syntax, grammar and data type; for guitar playing, picking strings, fret switches and chords recognition. 

There are also some high level concepts. For writing, these include plots of stories, structure of the scene, negative spaces; for programming, there is API design, object orientation, recursion; for guitar playing, there is musicality, improvising.

Although these concepts might be exposed to a beginner simultaneously, the higher concepts could not be fully understood without full understanding of the lower ones. It is impossible to write a well-plotted stories if the author still struggles with the spelling of most of its vocabularies, or a programmer to write web application if he struggles with the syntaxes of the language.

But these high level concepts tend to get more attension than the basic ones. The first reason might be they are disucssed more often by the experts in that fields. Experts rarely talk about basics. However, this doesn't mean their ignorance of the importance of basics. They are talking these high level concepts because those basics are already part of their natural movement. Their work or performance are built on top of the basics.

Another reason might be they are very abstract and when beginners get to know it, they will easily think they've understood it "in general". These high level concepts are ambiguous for beginners and are more easily discussed. This kinf of understanding is merely an illusion. It is useless if someone could only talk about these concepts without applying them onto the work.

So, for a beginner, it is more important to focus on the basics. High level concepts could be processed and fully understood onlyif those basics have been natrual to your body.

## Make Bold Choice and Execute Them 
A lot of choices must be made for a beginner. Which guitar should I play? Acoustic or electric? Which language should I use to program? Python, Ruby or Scheme? Which vocabulary list should I follow? 

The answers is **any one** which you find most inspiring and motivating. It doesn't matter for which choices you make in the first place. There are many routes to get somewhere and the primary choice is to choose one and move forward. 

Beginners are always worry about whether they will make a wrong decision for some important choices. Do I write in the right style? Do I play the right guitar? Do I choose the right language?  However, if the choices are really that important to you, they will come to you in the future and you will make your mature choices then.

So make decision and focus your effort on execution.

## Learn the 'Language'
Language is the medium we used to read, think and think in the certain fields. For certain fields, there is some subset of the language related with it. This subset of language is used by experts to exchange domain specific knowledge. 

When I am studying Economics, I get used to the words such as inflation, equilibrium, macro economics, supply and demand etc; When I am studying programming, I learned about algorithm, shell, kernel, pointer, recursion etc. 

Although learning this sub category of language itself doesn't equal learning the knowledge. But these specific subset of language is a good clue to know more about the fields. 

It helps you read better in those fields and expresses yourself better if you need someone's help. So you should make some deliberate effort to look up those vocabulary in wikipedia or Encyclopedia Britannica.

- also help to make it fun

## Guide yourself by Hardness
The starting experience is usually unpleasant. It might be hard to reason out a very simple sentences in a when studying foreign language, hard to play the simpliest scales, hard to write a small piece of program that doesn't generate an error.

This hardness usually leads to frustration which will stop beginners advancing. On the contrary, if we think this hardness as a sign of where we could make progress, they are actually very good signs about where should we put our effort to.

If we some words are very hard to understand, we could look up dictionaries to learn more examples about it; if we feel certain scales are hard to play, we could put more exercises on them and let our muscle get used to that; if we constantly make certian type errors in program, we could look up the documentation to get to know more details about them.

We could also focus our short term goals to eliminate those hardness. With continuous effort, we will find ourselves more comfortable for that particular practice and this generates feeling of accomplishment and help to keep the morale high.

## Conclusion
These are some of the lessons that are I learned when I started learning English and programming. The central is to keep motivation high - that's what will help you survive the 'death valley of giving up'. To get through the hard beginning phase, you need to focus on small steps and put efforts onto the basics. Do not worry about the choices you make, worry about the actions you are not take. Also you should make deliberate effor to learn the vocabulary in that fields and live with the
hardness and let it guide you through this journey.
