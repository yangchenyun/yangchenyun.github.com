In late 2010, I began to teach myself programming from scratch. Two years have passed and I have become a [professional programmer][github-profile]. Along the way, I have also learned some basic web and graphic design.

Self-learning is an exploring experience. Along the way, I've learned, tested and applied some principles about learning itself in general. Surprisingly, these principles are often misunderstood or ignored by most people, even by education institutions.

Recently as I've started learning guitar, I think this will be a good chance to sort out these principles.

在2010年末的时候，我开始从头自学编程。两年后，编程成了我[职业的一部分][github-profile]. 在这个过程中，我也自学了网页和平面设计。

这个自学的过程是对自己的一次探索。在这个探索的过程中，我学习，测试和应用了一些学习原则和学习方法。令人惊讶的是，这些学习原则和方法却被大多数的人误解和忽视了，甚至是大部分的教育机构也没有把他们教授给学生。

最近我又开始从头自学吉他，我觉得这是一个好的机会让我可以梳理这些原则和学习方法，并分享给大家。

## Keep Yourself Motivated All the Time 时刻保持动力
Motivation matters. 

Continuous effort is required to build skills and it is hard to commit that effort without being motivated **during the whole learning process**. People tend to give up shortly after they decided to start something new, even those who are highly motivated in the first place.

Given any book series, the first volume always outsells later sequences; among curriculum provided by schools, introductory courses are more popular than advanced ones; in gym business, registered members are are much more than regular ones.  People tend to initialize something on a hunch but few will succeed to develop it into a hobby, fewer into a profession. 

This phenomena are common because motivation doesn't arrive naturally, deliberate effort is required to achieve that.

动力是重要的。

掌握一门技能必须经过长期持续的努力，但如果缺少了**持续的动力**非常难在这个过程中坚持下来。人们常常会在决心学一样新的东西不久后懈怠然后放弃，即使是那些在一开始下定决心的人。

看看书店里的系列图书，第一册总是比后面几册卖的要好；那些学校和教育机构提供的课程里，入门的课程总是比高级课程更受欢迎；在健身房里面，注册的会员人数远远多过每天来锻炼的人。人们常常会因为一时的兴起而开始新的学习，但非常少的人能够把他们发展成为兴趣，更少的人能发展成为职业。

这现象那么普遍是非常自然的，因为学习的动力并不是自然而然生成的，我们需要有意识的去激发和维持学习的动力。

### Realize the Difficulties and Set Proper Expectation 意识到学习的困难和设置合理的预期
When people decide to initialize a learning, they never vision the resulting tedious details, boring exercises and uncomfortable stretches. In fact, it requires hardwork to start learning anything. To learn a foreign language, it is necessary to memorize the basic vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation; to learn a music instrument, scale exercises is required to let the muscle get used to movements on the instrument; to learn programming, basic syntaxes and tedious rules are required to stay sane with computers.

The starting process is especially difficult because it usually takes quite a long period before a beginner realizes the outcome of the effort. It might takes several months to speak or write a paragraphs of sentences in a foreign language, play the first complete song or write first practical program. The beginning phase of learning is like the 'death valley' - dry, harsh and seems forever. 

Most people don't expect those difficulties in advance so frustration comes up when the initial expectation mismatches the reality. To avoid this frustration, it is necessary to realize the difficulties in the first places. Make yourself prepared for the difficulties is necessary to guarantee the continuous effort required. 

With the proper expectation setup and preparation for coming difficulties, you will get less frustration when encounter them in reality. Then it is time to learn to keep motivated along the way.

当人们决定要开始学习的时候，他们很难预见到学习中那些冗长的细节，无聊的练习和让自己感觉非常不舒适的训练。事实上，任何的学习都需要经过这个困难的过程。如果学习一门外语，背诵基本的词汇，语法和正确的发音就是必须的；如果学习一门乐器，就必须通过音阶的练习形成肌肉记忆；如果学习编程，就必须学习基本的语法规则来和计算机交互。

学习开始的过程是尤其困难的，因为初学者通常要经过相当长的一段时间才能意识到他努力的结果。对于任意一项学习，好几个月以后，初学者才能简单的用外语来书写或者做口语交流，或者学会弹一首非常简单的曲子，或者去写一个简单的实用程序。这最初的阶段像死亡峡谷一样 - 无聊，艰苦还毫无尽头。

大多数的人并不会提前意识到这些困难，所以当他们的预期和现实冲突的时候，沮丧的情绪就可想而知了。为了避免这沮丧的情绪，在最初的时候对这些困难做好心里准备就非常重要。

有了正确的预期和对困难的准备，当在学习的过程中遇到困难的时候就不会特别的沮丧和气馁。然后我们可以说说如何在学习的过程中保持动力。

### Seek Motivation Deliberately 主动寻找学习的动力
Motivation could be collected from external source. You could deliberately look for materials which inspire you and it doesn't need to be directly related to the fields you are studying. When I start learning programming from scratch, I collect short inspiring quotes deliberately and turn this collection into a [website][qotto-site] which I set as default home page for my browser. Those quotes keep me in charged and provide me energy to move forward.

Motivation could be cultivated internally as well. The hunch which drives you to learning is a good place to start. Ask yourself why you want to acquire those skills in the first place. It's okay the motivation doesn't sound noble but it must matter to yourself. Once you dig out the motivation, keep reminding yourself of it. You could write them down, paste them on the wall, set them as your screen saver etc.  

你可以从外部去寻找学习的动力。例如你可以主动的搜集那些让你兴奋或者有动力的材料. 当我开始学习编程的时候，我主动搜集了许多箴言来激励我坚持联系，我把这些引言也做成了[网站][qotto-site]并且设置成为了我浏览器的首页。 这些箴言让我保持学习的动力。

动力也可以从内部挖掘。那最初让你决定学习的冲动通常是很好的开始。问问你自己为什么想掌握这些技能。不必去寻找什么高尚的原因，但它必须和你自己相关。如果你发觉出来了这个动机，常常提醒你自己。例如，你可以把他们写下来，贴在墙上或者设置成自己的桌面壁纸。

### Focus on Steps, One at a Time 每次专注一小步
A clear goal helps keep motivation high but locking yourself to that goal is, sometimes, counter-productive.

Saying you have found your motivation - speak Spanish with foreign friends met at hostel, learn basic strokes to draw pictures effortlessly, write programs to build a website etc., if you only keep your eyes on those goals, the necessary exercises and effort become painful and unpleasant things which have to be taken to reach that destination. **The process itself becomes frustrating.**

However, if you think on a broader scale, **the destination doesn't exists**. Even for professionals, there is always space to improve. How would you tell that one writer has reached the "destination" of writing, or one musician has developed all the skills to perform music. For any type of activity, there is an endless journey upfront. Anything is serious enough to commit a life long effort.

Because there is no destination, the painful and unpleasant daily activities **are** the journey. Instead of feeling obliged and restricted about the boring and tedious exercises, you should embrace and enjoy this experience because this is part of the things you are learning.

Then focus on individual steps and pay the attention to however tiny progress made everyday. Pay attention and be proud of how you've learned to pronounce a new word, how you could play the scale more faster, how you understand some new syntaxes.

When you focus on the individual steps, you will collect positive feedback along the way, this feedback will generate motivation which later builds up the momentum helpful to move your forward.

有个清晰的目标能够帮助保持动力，但如果只让自己看到那个目标有的时候却有相反的作用。

假设已经找到的自己的目标 - 例如可以和旅行中的朋友说西班牙语，可以把街景画下来，制作自己的个人网站。如果你把注意力都放在目标上，那些每天必须的练习和努力就变得非常的痛苦，它们像是到达彼岸不得不经历的事。**这样学习的过程本身就变得很沮丧了**.

但是，如果你把眼光放的更远一些，那个**设置的目标其实是不存在的**。就算是对达到了职业水准的人而言，他们总是有进步的空间的。我们不能评判说一个作家已经达到了写作的最终目标或者一个音乐家已经完成了所有的音乐技能。对于任何类型的活动，它都有一个永无止境的进步空间。如果你对待他们足够认真的话，任何一件事情都可以用上一辈子的时间来钻研。

因为目标实际上并不存在，那些不愉快和无聊的练习本身就是这个过程的**全部**. 那么我们并不应该对它们在感到拘束和沮丧，而应该享受这个过程，因为它们就是你要学习的技能的必经之路。

你应该专注在每一步，把注意力放在每天都在进行的极小的进步当中。注意那些新学到的东西，哪怕它是新学会的一个发音，新学会的一个音阶或者是新看懂的一个语法。

如果你专注在学习的每一步上，你可以从每天的练习中汲取动力，这样的反馈会让你积累起持续的动力使你不断进步和成长。

## Choose the Direction to Make Effort 选择一个努力的方向
Once you have learned to keep your motivation high, you are ready to invest your efforts in your studies. 

For a beginner in one field, there are a lot of choices needed to be made. These choices certainly contribute to the progress you might make along the way. 

当你学会保持动力之后，你就准备好了投入到学习中去了。
对于任何一个领域的初学者来说，那里有无数的选择需要进行。这些选择会影响到学习的进度。

### Start from the Basics 从基础开始
In any fields, there are several levels of concepts which might be exposed to you. Some are the basics. In learning a language, vocabulary, grammar and spelling are the basic; in programming, syntax, data type, clauses are the basics; in guitar playing, fretting switches, chord chart reading, picking and strumming are the basics.

There are also high level concepts. In learning a language, they include tones, choices of words, idioms; in programming, API design, object orientation, recursion; in guitar playing, musicality, negative spaces.

These two kinds of concepts are usually exposed to a beginner simultaneously, but the higher concepts could not be fully understood without full understanding of the lower ones. It is impossible to write a well-structured articles in one language if the author still struggles with the meaning and spelling of most of the vocabulary, or a programmer to write an application when he is still confused by the syntaxes of the language.

Despite the dependencies, beginners are inclined to learn the high-level concepts instead of low-level ones.  This is reasonable tendency. Learning the basics usually requires plain, tedious, repeated exercises. Memorize vocabulary, do picking exercises, read language specifics. These basics seem to have no relationship with the work carried out by experts. It is easily get bored practicing those basics.  On the other hand, the ambiguity of high-level concepts makes them easily to be understood 'in general'. This 'general understanding' creates an illusion in the beginners to believe they have grasped this concept by being able to talk about this concepts. 

The attractiveness of high-level concepts will misguide the beginners to give up practicing the basics and jump to learn the high-level concepts. This will in fact slow down the actual progress they will make.

Slow is fast. For a beginner, it is more important to focus on the basics. Practice those basics until these become natural to the brain or body. Then the high level concepts could be processed and fully understood.

在任何一个领域里，初学者都会接触到很多层次的概念。有些是很基本的，例如在语言里，它们包括词汇，语法和拼写；在程序设计里，它们包括语法，数据结构和程序分句；在吉他里，它们包括音阶，和弦的转化，乐谱的识别以及扫弦的动作等等。

除此之外，也有一些复杂的概念。在语言里，它们包括句子的语调，词句的斟酌和一些俚语的使用；在程序设计里，它们包括程序接口的实现，面向对象的设计和递归；在吉他演奏里，它们包括音乐风格和留白。

初学者常常在同一时间接受这两种概念。但是在初级的概念被完全掌握之前，初学者并不能真正理解那些复杂的概念。一个还挣扎于拼写和单词含义的作者不可能写出一篇构思精巧的文章，一个还挣扎于理解程序的语法的程序员也不能设计出完整的应用程序。

虽然高级的概念依赖于低级的概念，但初学者更倾向于提前学习高级的概念。 这是比较容易理解的偏好。因为低级的概念常常意味着无聊而重复的练习 - 单词记忆，拨片练习，或者阅读语言文档。这些基础似乎和那些专家在进行的工作毫无关联。 这些基础的训练很快就让人不耐烦了。 相反地，那些高级概念因为它们的抽象性，使得它们常常被“在一定意义”上理解了。这种意识往往会让初学者产生错觉，认为当他们可以谈论这些概念的时候就已经理解的了。

因此高级的概念会误导初学者，并让他们忽略初级的训练，而痴心于高级的概念之中。但恰恰相反，这些会使得他们的进展变的更缓慢，甚至止步不前。

慢在这里就是快。对于初学者而言，更应该把重心放在基础之上。练习那些基础的东西直到它们已经成为身体或者大脑的自然反应。 在那个时候，高级的概念才能够被真正的理解。

### When in Doubt, Make Instinct Decision 当有疑问的时候，跟随直觉
Besides the choices between low-level ones and high-level ones, there are still a lot of detailed choices to be made for a beginner. Which dictionary should I purchase when learning Spanish? Which guitar should I play? Acoustic or electric? Which language should I use to start programming? Python, Ruby or C? 

The answers is **any one** which you find most accessible and inspiring. These detailed choices don't matter that much comparing with the effort to move forward. If you master playing the acoustic guitar, it won't be hard to switch to an electric one; if you master Ruby, it only takes days to work with Python.

And those really important choices will reveal themselves to you later in the future when you are mature enough to distinguish the difference then.

So when you are in doubt, just make one decision and move forward.

除去在低级和高级概念里面的选择之外，初学者还会面对其他很细节的选择。例如我该选择怎么样的字典，我该选择电子还是古典吉他，我该选择学习哪一门编程的语言？Ruby，Python还是C？

答案是**任何一个**你能够接触到并让你感到兴奋的。细节的选择并不那么重要，重要的是能有所行动并不断进步。如果你掌握了如何演奏古典吉他，演奏电子吉他并是难事。如果你掌握了Ruby，通常只需要几天时间就能用Python进行工作了。

那些真正非常重要的选择会在之后再次出现的，在那个时候你一定已经具备了去分辨两种选择的知识了。

所以说，当你对眼前的选择犹豫的时候，就做一个选择，然后持续往前。

### Follow the Uncomfortable Zone 跟随不舒适的感觉
The starting experience is usually unpleasant. It might be hard to reason out a very simple sentences when studying a foreign language, hard to play the simplest scales, hard to write a small piece of program that doesn't generate an error.

This hardness usually leads to frustration which will stop beginners making progress. On the contrary, if you think this hardness as a sign of where progress could be made, they are actually very good guidelines about where to put effort on.

If you find some words very hard to understand, you could look up dictionaries to learn more examples about it; if you feel certain scales are hard to play, you could put more exercises on them and let your muscle get used to that; if you constantly make certain type errors in program, you could look up the documentation to get to know more details about them.

You could also focus the short term goals to eliminate those hardness. With continuous effort, you will find yourself more comfortable for that particular practice and this generates feeling of accomplishment and help to keep the morale high.

开始学习的经历总是非常不舒服的。比如你可能需要花很多时间来想明白一个非常简单的句子，或者练习一个非常简单的音阶，或者写一段非常简单的代码。

这些困难常常让初学者望而却步。但与之相反，如果我们把困难当作是可以获得进步的信号，它们就成了引导我们努力的指南针了。

如果你发现有些单词非常难理解，你可以打开字典，去学习更多它们的用法；如果你感觉有些音阶很难练习，就应该做跟多的练习让肌肉熟悉那个动作，如果你发现在程序里常常犯某一种错误，就应该去查看文档并了解它们内部更多的细节实现。

你也可以用之前提到过的方法，例如关注短期的进步来减低任务的难度。通过持续的长时间的练习，你会慢慢发现自己适应了它们。这种进步非常容易察觉，所以也会帮助你保持学习的动力。

## Conclusion 总结
These are some of the principles that I have learned when I started learning programming and design. The central is to keep motivation high - that's what will help you survive the 'death valley of giving up'. To get through the hard beginning phase, you need to focus on small steps and put efforts on the basics. Do not worry about the choices you make, worry about the actions you are not about to take. You should live with the stretches and let the uncomfortable stretches guide you through the journey of learning.

以上是我初学设计和编程的过程中总结的一些学习原则。它们的核心是保持学习的动力 - 它们将帮助你度过“死亡峡谷”. 为了熬过最初的困难的阶段，你需要专注在每一个小步骤上然后在基础上下功夫。 不要担心你的选择，担心你没有把它们付诸于行动。 你应该要适应那些“拉伸活动”，同时让那些不舒服的感觉引导你进行学习。
