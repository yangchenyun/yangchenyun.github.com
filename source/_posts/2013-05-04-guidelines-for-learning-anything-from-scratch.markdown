In late 2010, I began to teach myself programming from scratch. Two years have passed and I have become a [professional programmer][github-profile] and developed basic web and graphic design skills.

Self-learning is an exploring experience. I've learned, tested and applied some principles about learning itself in general. Surprisingly, these principles are often misunderstood or ignored by most people, even by education institutions.

Started learning guitar recently, I think it is the right time to sort out these principles.

## Keep Yourself Motivated All the Time
Motivation matters. 

Continuous effort is required to build skills and it is hard to commit that effort without being motivated **during the whole learning process**. People tend to give up shortly after they decided to start something new, even those who are highly motivated at the beginning.

Given any book series, the first volume always outsells later sequences; among curriculum provided by schools, introductory courses are more popular than advanced ones; in gym business, registered members are much more than regular ones.  People tend to initialize something on a hunch but few will succeed to develop it into a hobby, fewer into a profession. 

These phenomena are common because motivation doesn't arrive naturally, deliberate effort is required to obtain that.

### Realize the Difficulties and Set Proper Expectation 
When people decide to initialize a learning process, they rarely vision the resulting tedious details, boring exercises and uncomfortable stretches. To learn a foreign language, memorizing the basic vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation is required before serious reading and writing; to learn a music instrument, scale exercise is required to let the muscle get used to movements on the instrument; to learn programming, basic syntaxes and tedious rules are required to stay sane with computers.

The starting process is especially difficult because it usually takes quite a long period before a beginner realizes the outcome of the effort. It might takes several months to speak or write a paragraph of sentences in a foreign language, play the first complete song or write first practical program. The beginning phase of learning is like the 'death valley' - dry, harsh and seems forever. 

Frustration comes up when the initial expectation mismatches the reality. To avoid this frustration, it is necessary to be aware of the difficulties that might come and be as much prepared as possible in advance. With the proper expectation setup and preparation for coming difficulties, you will get less frustration when encounter them in reality. Then it is time to learn to keep motivated along the way.

### Seek Motivation Deliberately 
Motivation could be collected from external source. You could deliberately look for materials which inspire you and it doesn't need to be directly related to the fields you are studying. When I started learning programming from scratch, I collected short inspiring quotes deliberately and turn this collection into a [website][qotto-site] which I set as default home page in the browser. Those quotes fed me inspiration to move forward.

Motivation could be cultivated internally as well. The hunch which drives you to learning is a good place to start. Ask yourself why you want to acquire those skills in the first place. It's okay the motivation doesn't sound noble but it must matter to yourself. Once you dig out the motivation, keep reminding yourself of it. You could write them down, paste them on the wall, set them as your screen saver etc.  

### Focus on Steps, One at a Time
A clear goal helps keep motivation high but locking yourself to that goal is, sometimes, counter-productive.

Saying you have found your motivation - speak Spanish with foreign friends met in hostel, learn basic strokes to draw pictures effortlessly, write programs to build a website etc., if you only keep your eyes on those goals, the necessary exercises and effort become painful and unpleasant things which have to be taken to reach that destination. **The process itself becomes frustrating.**

However, if you think on a broader scale, **the destination doesn't exist**. Even for professionals, there is always space to improve. How would you tell that one writer has reached the "destination" of writing, or one musician has developed all the skills to perform music. Anything is serious enough to commit a lifelong effort so that there is no destination but an endless journey with seemingly painful, repetitive but rewarding daily activities.

Instead of feeling obliged and restricted about the boring and tedious exercises, it is better to embrace and enjoy this experience because this experience together with the resulting progress is the whole of learning.

Then focus on individual steps and pay attention to however tiny progress made every day. Be proud of how you've learned to pronounce a new word, how you could play the scale faster, how you have grasped the meaning of new programming syntaxes.

When focusing on the individual steps, you will collect positive feedback along the way, which will serve as greater momentum to move you forward.

## Choose the Direction to Make Effort 
Once you have learned to keep your motivation high, you are ready to invest your efforts in your studies. 

For a beginner in one field, there are a lot of choices needed to be made. These choices certainly determine how much progress you might make along the way. 

### Start from the Basics
In any fields, there are several levels of concepts which might be exposed to you. Some are the basics. In learning a language, vocabulary, grammar and spelling are the basic; in programming, syntax, data structure, clauses are the basics; in guitar playing, chord switches, playing scales, picking and strumming are the basics.

There are also high level concepts. In learning a language, they include tones, choices of words, idioms; in programming, design pattern, abstraction, architecture; in guitar playing, musicality, negative spaces and dynamics.

These two kinds of concepts are usually exposed to a beginner simultaneously, but the higher concepts could not be fully understood without a comprehensive understanding of the lower ones. It is impossible to write a well-structured articles in one language if the author still struggles with the meaning and spelling of most of the vocabulary, same for a programmer to write an application when he is still confused by the syntaxes of the language.

Despite the dependencies, beginners are inclined to learn the high-level concepts instead of low-level ones.  This is reasonable tendency. Learning the basics usually requires plain, tedious, repeated exercises. Memorize vocabulary, do picking exercises, read language specifics. These basics seem to have no relationship with the work carried out by experts. It is easily get bored practicing those basics.  On the other hand, the ambiguity of high-level concepts makes them easily to be understood 'in general'. This 'general understanding' creates an illusion in the beginners to believe they have grasped this concept by being able to talk about these concepts. 

The attractiveness of high-level concepts will misguide the beginners to skip practicing the basics and jump to the high-level ones. This will in fact slow down the actual progress they could potentially make.

Slow is fast. For a beginner, it is more important to focus on the basics. Practice those basics until they become natural to the brain and the high level concepts will come to presence at their own.

### When in Doubt, Make Instinct Decision
Besides the choices between low-level ones and high-level ones, there are still a lot of detailed choices to be made for a beginner. Which dictionary should I purchase when learning Spanish? Which guitar should I play? Acoustic or electric? Which language should I use to start programming? Python, Ruby or C? 

The answer is **any one** which you find most accessible and inspiring. These detailed choices don't matter that much comparing with the effort to move forward. If you master the acoustic guitar, it won't be hard to switch to an electric one; if you master Ruby, it only takes days to work with Python.

And those really important choices will reveal themselves to you later in the future when you are mature enough to distinguish the difference then.

So when you are in doubt, just follow your instinct and move forward.

### Follow the Uncomfortable Zone
The starting experience is usually unpleasant. It might be hard to reason out a very simple sentence when studying a foreign language, hard to play the simplest scales, hard to write a small piece of program that doesn't generate an error.

This hardness usually leads to frustration which stops beginners making progress. But why not see it as a sign of where breakthroughs can be made?

If you find some words very hard to understand, you could look up dictionaries to learn more examples about it; if you feel certain scales are hard to play, you could put more exercises on them and let your muscle get used to that; if you constantly make certain type of errors when programming, you could look up the documentation for more details.

Focusing on the short term goals also helps, With continuous effort, you will find yourself more comfortable with what you are practicing, which in turn generates feeling of accomplishment and help to keep the morale high.

## Conclusion
These are some of the principles that I have gleaned from my own learning experience and which, I believe, underlies what will really help you survive the 'death valley of giving up' -- keep motivation high. To get through the hard beginning phase, you need to focus on small steps and put efforts on the basics. Do not worry about the choices you make, worry about the actions you are not about to take. You should live with the stretches and let the uncomfortable stretches guide you through the journey of learning.
